## 🚀 How can I run it?

You need to have NodeJS and GIT installed on your device for running this project.
Also, be sure to have a database running on docker and make the needed alterations on the database config file for making the connection.

I truly recommend you to just create a .env file at the root of the project and put there variables needed in 'database.js' config file.

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/heyloh/school-rest-api.git
```
2. Go to the project directory:
```sh
$ cd school-rest-api/
```
3. Install the dependencies:
```sh
$ yarn # or npm i
```
4. Run the server:
```sh
$ yarn dev # or npm run dev
```

Now you should be able to work on or just test the API.
